# IP Mapper

-Everyone can use it

-Goal is to provide Internet users service of finding out some additional data using IP address

This web app will be made with MERN stack and hosted via Heroku. The way it works is that the user types in IP address in order to determine the country, region or state, city, latitude, longitude, ZIP code, time zone, proxy type, country, region, city, ISP, domain, usage type, ASN and last seen proxy for it. Also IP address can be translated to autonomous system (AS) and autonomous system number (ASN). Everyone can use this service, but registered users have access to more features than the regular visitors to the website.
